# ebusd-conf_wolf-cgu-2k-18_wolf-rm-2
ebusd csv files for wolf cgu-2k-18 and wolf rm-2

# Currently this is work in progress
as I am exploring the csv format and the commands on my bus.

# My System identifies as:
```
[update notice] sent scan-read scan.08  QQ=31: ENCON;  ;-;-
[bus notice] scan 08: ;ENCON;  ;-;-
[main notice] read scan config file encon/08..hc.csv for ID "", SW65535, HW65535

[update notice] sent scan-read scan.35  QQ=31: Wolf; 8;0110;0000
[bus notice] scan 35: ;Wolf; 8;0110;0000
[main notice] read scan config file wolf/35..hc.csv for ID "8", SW0110, HW0000

[main error] scan config f6: ERR: read timeout
```

I habe several command types:
- BC = Burner Circruit
- MS = ?
- MM = ?

# Please be careful
I am no expert and these files are not validated in any kind of way.
